# react-ecosystems

React is rarely used by itself. As a result, working effectively with React—especially when developing in a group—means mastering a set of tools. Some of these tools supplement React, while others establish and maintain workflows for efficient development or help React mesh with another set of web-centric tools. In this project, I try to make full use of React by exploring its ecosystems, and investigating what React offers as the nucleus of this system. demonstrating what React offers, and dive into topics such as routing and navigation, server-side rendering, animation, and debugging.

* Routing
* Navigation
* Server-side rendering
* State management
* Reviewing an animation library
* Testing and debugging
* Type checking in React

* Building more maintainable and robust React applications
* Installing React and other tools
* Adding Redux
* Dealing with side effects
* Libraries for dealing with side effects
* Styling React apps more effectively with styled-components
* Using React hooks
* React fragments
* Testing Redux, Redux-Thunk, Reselect, and styled-components

Uses some of the most important tools in the React ecosystem that simplify development and manage the complexities of state, side effects, structure, and styling.I try to create a basic React project, and then add Redux, create thunks, use selectors, work with styled-components, perform testing, and more.
